                                    Saman was designed as a mascot character for personal blog <span class="a_decoy">
                                    "Pomogaev Totals"</span>. He was meant to represent the author of the blog on post cover images.
                                    As a basis for the character were used author's appearance and common visual features, such as
                                    green hat used as Redencon's profile image, hoodie (the color of which was shifted
                                    from red to green for color balance) and a small tablet, always present in Saman's
                                    hands. The initial pose also included a pointer stick, but in later crops it was
                                    never seen. Saman as cover mascot was used in all Totals posts ever since and grew
                                    to be strongly associated with the author.
                                </p>
                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-3">
                                    Saman's initial species was a fire salamander, because of the author's love for amphibians,
                                    and a fire salamander's bright colors and patterns. Saman as salamander is used in most
                                    <a href="https://t.me/addstickers/rdfgl_stickers">Telegram stickers</a>
                                    and gifted art. The name was invented more than half a year after
                                    the character's debut as a mascot. Before naming the character "Saman", Redencon always
                                    used just the name "Salamander" in file names, as the character's name never appeared in
                                    blog posts. In the meantime, the work on <a href="ocs/Flenco.html">Flenco</a> was started,
                                    and was later often a subject of jokes, because the character which was never drawn already
                                    had a name, while the Totals mascot seen in blog posts every week didn't.
                                </p>
                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-3">
                                    At some point Redencon acquired a VR headset, and then arose the question of making a VRChat
                                    avatar of Saman and/or Flenco. Salamander models are quite uncommon among bases Redencon
                                    knew of, so he chose a rather radical change: Saman's color palette and patterns were
                                    applied to <a href="https://ghostcabbit.gumroad.com/l/freakhound">Freakhound</a> base, following
                                    a joke made in a <a href="https://telegra.ph/Furri-01-12">blog post</a> a year ago,
                                    where the Saman on cover was drawn as a wolf. The
                                    ease of use of Freakhound base and the quality of the custom texture applied to it made the
                                    Freakhound Saman more recognizable and widely used than the original salamander picture.
                                    Ever since, Saman is drawn as either salamander or Freakhound, basically splitting one
                                    character in two. The common features of a dog-Freakhound-Saman made it possible to
                                    start the process of making a fursuit for the character, which is still in progress.
