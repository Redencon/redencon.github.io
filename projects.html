                                    <p>With the need to provide user-friendly alternative to a collection of CLI-only tools, often chained by hand in Jupyter notebooks by tool creators, an idea of GUI with workflows was born. This project aims to create the pipeline of completing peptide search in MS/MS data with further validation and quntification - all within single suite with all connections already thought through. My part in this project is providing visual elements and output windows with simple data management functionality with the use of Tkinter - a native Python GUI. Although hard and oftentimes ungrateful task, it led to a current state of relatively nice and compact app, but with quite a slow response.</p>

                                    <p>Continuing on the crusade to make all the tools lab has into nice apps with appealing interfaces, this time I was asked to make my Dash app for quantification analysis (effectively doubling existing CLI tool <a href="https://github.com/kazakova/Metrics">QRePS</a>) into a standalone tool suitable for any type of quick analyses. It is much more simple than Perseus - a similar tool designed for Max Quant, but with it's simplicity comes ease to use and relatively small size: this shiny app with Python 3.11 in it and all of it's dependancies can be compressed into a tiny 140MB zip archive. Impressive!</p>

                                    <p>Rabotyaga bot is a bot for Telegram, which assists Studen council activists in their work. It forwards messages from group inbox into Telegram, organizes events and polls, provides basic chat bot functionality, stores memes. Initially it was designed as a linker solution between Telegram and coda API, as coda was (and still is) very mobile-unfriendly, and bot should have made the activist's job easier. Although this module still works, the lack of interest in coda as a whole makes such features redundant.</p>

                                    <p>PSI-bots: Nastyenka and Diana were imagined as a simple tool for conducting a <span class="tooltip_il">longitudal<span class="tooltiptext_il"> questioning respondends several times over time instead of once</span> </span> research of students' mental health. With initial 1-5 numeric questions, some time and foreign inspirations were needed to come to a recognizable formula of 7 colorful hearts (later made customizable) as a staple of well made daily polling. Even small at launch, bot got to 50 daily users without any external incentives other than students' will to use the bot.</p>

                                    <p>All five semesters of General Physics had a lab practice. The premise of each work is to conduct a miniature research on some specific physical effect, collect and analyze the data and make some conclusions. First year physics was teached by "Old School" teachers promoting the use of pen and pencils for the whole work, but all further courses the more modern approach was welcomed: building plots and doing statistical analysys on computer (with Python in my case) and then print the LaTeX version of a final report. This course made me very comfortable with Python as analytics and visualization tools. When working in teams, I prefereed to take the role of data wrangler and plot builder.</p>

                                    <p>Well before BiotechDay 2024 was announced, event team contacted me with request to create a news bot for them to inform participants of any updates and to provide event schedule and registrations. For this bot I've written a new bot basis for the stateful bot with descision tree, as well as questionnaire module and SQLAlchemy integration module. This was the interesting experience to develop the project fully by "customer" requests and I've learnt a lot about scheduling and SQL use in Python. Different code snippets from biotechday bot are used in my other projects, as they were quite successful.</p>

                                    <p>I joined the Mental Health Questionnaire team as an analyst at MKI's 2022 Autumn "Vyezd". Our main focus was to find which student groups have the poorest mental health condition and if these groups are avoiding Phystech psychologists. It was an important research with important conclusions, although in retrospect our methods were questionable to say the least. Later iterations of this questionnaire greately reduced the observed severity of the problem, but confirmed that the problem is real.</p>
