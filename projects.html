                                                With the need to provide a user-friendly alternative to a collection of CLI-only tools,
                                                often chained by hand in Jupyter notebooks by tool creators, an idea of GUI with workflows
                                                was born. This project aims to create the pipeline of completing peptide search in MS/MS
                                                data with further validation and quantification - all within a single suite with all connections
                                                already thought through. My part in this project is providing visual elements and output windows
                                                with simple data management functionality with the use of Tkinter - a native Python GUI.
                                                Although it is a hard and oftentimes ungrateful task, it led to a current state of relatively
                                                nice and compact app, but with quite a slow response.

                                            Rabotyaga bot is a bot for Telegram, which assists Student council activists
                                            in their work. It forwards messages from group inbox into Telegram,
                                            organizes events and polls, provides basic chatbot functionality, stores memes.
                                            Initially it was designed as a linker solution between Telegram and coda API,
                                            as coda was (and still is) very mobile-unfriendly, and bot should have made
                                            the activist's job easier. Although this module still works, the lack of interest
                                            in coda as a whole makes such features redundant.

                                            Well before BiotechDay 2024 was announced, the event team contacted me with
                                            a request to create a news bot for them to inform participants of any updates
                                            and to provide event schedule and registrations. For this bot, I've written
                                            a new bot basis for the stateful bot with decision tree, as well as questionnaire
                                            module and SQLAlchemy integration module. This was the interesting experience
                                            to develop the project fully by "customer" requests, and I've learned

                                            All five semesters of General Physics had a lab practice. The premise of each work
                                            is to conduct a miniature research on some specific physical effect, collect and analyze
                                            the data and make some conclusions. First year physics was taught by "Old School"
                                            teachers promoting the use of pen and pencils for the whole work, but all further

                                            analysis on computer (with Python in my case) and then print the LaTeX version of
                                            a final report. This course made me very comfortable with Python as analytics
                                            and visualization tools. When working in teams, I preferred to take the role

                                            Our main focus was to find which student groups have the poorest mental health condition
                                            and if these groups are avoiding Phystech psychologists. It was an important research
                                            with important conclusions, although in retrospect our methods were questionable, 
                                            to say the least. Later iterations of this questionnaire greatly reduced
                                            the observed severity of the problem, but confirmed that the problem is real.

                                            There are six interconnected buildings in MIPT campus with lots of study
                                            and lecture rooms. Sometimes it's hard to get where one can be from room's
                                            name alone. MKI planned to solve this problem by creating directional signs
                                            years ago, but the project never reached the implementation. In 2023 the idea
                                            to work on this project was suggested as a case for annual "Vyezd" and I, with
                                            Alice decide to lead this project. With the newly created team we developed
                                            a design code for future signs, and after a few more months of work the project
                                            was approved and financed by university administration. At that point we
                                            managed to add signs to Phystech.Quantum building, which was very positively
                                            accepted by students. In 2024, we continued to develop signs for other buildings
                                            and at this point, the project is almost ready to proceed to the next stage:
                                            signs in Applied Math, Main and Laboratory Buildings. All that remains is to
                                            get approval from the administration.

                                            Since the middle of first year in MIPT, I've been using Obsidian app to keep
                                            notes for my Math and Physics lectures. One day I discovered a feature to
                                            create daily notes with a template, and I decided to use it to keep track of
                                            my plans and to review the day. "Totals" - the title of the final section of
                                            these notes have started. Soon I started to publish them to tell others about
                                            how my day went. From a daily bulleted list of activities it grew into a blog
                                            about recent events in my life and in MIPT. Unfortunately, I've stopped actively
                                            writing articles for the blog, as studying, activism and work projects took
                                            over almost all of my time. I hope I'll be able to publish a semi-annual 
                                            review of the last semester, but I haven't yet started. All the stuff I Write
                                            here on this site help to get back to writing and scratches that itch to tell
                                            others more about me.
