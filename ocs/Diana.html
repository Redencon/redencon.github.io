                                    Diana is a complicated character. First sketch of Diana is the first time Redencon attempted
                                    to draw some original character doing something instead of just trying to replicate some other
                                    pictures. (Replicate without tracing, which was quite a challenge in measuring and fixing).
                                    In a way Diana was mascot for Redencon themselves, but she never was intended to be used as alias
                                    or representation. It's just the composition of a all the things Redencon thought of self at the
                                    time. As a result Diana is caffeine-addicted, permanently sour-mooded, both sad and strict with
                                    other characters. Perhaps Diana's appearence is the reason why Redencon attempted art in the first
                                    place - to give place for some inner anxieties to be outed.
                                </p>
                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-3">
                                    For a long time Diana remained a past character. Redencon acquired other representative personas
                                    and the most Diana had appearence as was a character in a small story. This story added "teacher"
                                    background to the character, as well as some deepened relationshps with other existing characters
                                    at the time. Around that time Olezha had made Diana wallpaper as part of his study of office suits.
                                    Thus Diana refreshed her presence, but still mostly in the background.
                                </p>
                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-3">
                                    At some point PSI bots appeared, and Nastya was already selected as a representative character.
                                    For technical reasons, the second bot of the same functionality was required, and with such scarce
                                    selection of female characters to choose from, Diana was chosen as the name and mascot character
                                    for this secondary bot. The icon was based on wallpaper made by Olez before, as it fitted the MKI
                                    blue theme really well. Later the power duo of Diana and Nastya was firmly established and Nastya was 
                                    added to the aforementioned wallpaper. Diana redesign was long overdue.
                                </p>
                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-3">
                                    Here we are - with Diana shifting away from MKI colors towards Redencon's pallete for personal projects,
                                    perhaps signifying the transition from MKI-centered development towards personal brand.
